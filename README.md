# XG – IN THE RAIN

> **歌詞登録ステータス：プレーン歌詞のみ**

```
Rain on my shoulder
Cloud in my head
Head over heels
Nothing to fear
'Cause we had each other
Fought through the weather
There were no other like this
And then you started
Hiding it sliding in
Baby it's so evident
Boy why are you stuttering
That mouth you still running it
(Good Bye good bye good bye)
Say you'd never been like that
Like that
Yeah I know it's a shame what a pity
You got nobody to blame but you baby
Night after night
All the times all the tries
I'm washing it all away because
You left me
In the rain in the rain in the rain
Left me out in the cold
With nobody to hold
Can't you see
I'm outside I'm outside I'm outside
So let it rain let it rain
What else can I do
Ain't no sign of a light
No umbrella to hide
Still I'm standing here
Right where you left me
In the rain in the rain in the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
Rain, rain don't go away
Please stay another day
Funny how I don't wanna make it stop (stop)
Heals every time it drop (drop) drop
Each drop
Right now you got me dancing in the rain
All by myself like I'm insane
But sometimes the words just can't explain
I don't really wanna think about anything
(Good Bye good bye good bye)
And you know I won't look back
Look back
It was only a game what a pity
Save it all in a frame without me baby
Pour down the drain
All the scars all the pain
I'm washing it all away because
You left me
In the rain in the rain in the rain
Left me out in the cold
With nobody to hold
Can't you see
I'm outside I'm outside I'm outside
So let it rain let it rain
What else can I do
Ain't no sign of a light
No umbrella to hide
Still I'm standing here
Right where you left me
In the rain in the rain in the rain
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
(In the rain in the rain in the rain)
Let it drip and drop down nonstop
Baby let me soak and scrub wash you off
In the rain
(Can't you see I'm outside I'm outside I'm
outside)
Drip and drop down nonstop
Baby let me soak and scrub wash you off
(What else can I do)
In the rain
(In the rain in the rain in the rain)
Drip and drop down nonstop
(No umbrella to hide)
Soak and scrub wash you off
(Still I'm standing here right now)
Can't you see
I'm outside I'm outside I'm outside
In the rain
In the rain
In the rain
